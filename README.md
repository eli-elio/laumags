I am Lauma and I used to be a biology and science teacher but then I realized that the IT field gives me more opportunities to grow and develop.

I want to constantly learn new things and grow, so I think programming is the perfect way to do that.

I am interested in Software development. I specialize in PHP and have experience working with Laravel and MySQL. I also have experience working with Angular, HTML & CSS.
